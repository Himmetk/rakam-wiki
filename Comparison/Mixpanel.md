Mixpanel is one of the first and probably the leading event analytics solution in the SaaS market. 
They collect data with their SDKs from your clients and allow you analyze your data with a user interface. 
We also have the similar flow for data ingestion, you can use our SDKs or API directly in order the send the event data 
and similar to Mixpanel, we provide segmentation (event explorer), funnel, retention, explore (user attribution) and insight (user drilldown).
The main difference between Rakam and Mixpanel is

### Differences

Mixpanel provide you a set of features to analyze your data, we handle the ETL and data warehouse for you and allow you to run any kind of complex analytic queries on your event dataset. 
On top of that, we have behavioral analytics APIs such as funnel and retention and do not enforce any limit for you to run your custom queries.
Rakam is also designed to handle any kind of event data and provide many more features such as webhooks and scheduled tasks 
so it's more like a data hub for your company.

they export metrics to Rakam periodically with scheduled tasks and integrate 
Facebook Ads and other third party services such as Intercom.io with webhooks and be able to see the big picture of their customer data.
