You can create dashboards from your reports. The dashboards are simply the summary of your reports, create reports and export summary of reports as boxes in dashboards. Not actually just reports, you can also export event explorer charts, retention and funnel graphs. You have the full control on layout of the dashboards, expand the size of boxes, move them etc.

You can also use variables in dashboards. If you expose variables with same name, the value of variables will be shared among the boxes. It basically means that you can create multiple custom dynamic dashboards.

The flow for dashboards is as follows: the developer writes SQL queries and creates reports for you. The analysts uses created reports and create dashboard boxes so that the CEO of your company and business guys can just look at dashboards in a single page.
