You can add new members to your projects in team page. [http://app.rakam.io/api/team](http://app.rakam.io/api/team)
When you add a new member, Rakam will automatically create new API keys and let the user to access the API keys that you specified. If you don't allow the user to have administrator access, Rakam will only give access to user for `write_key` and `read_key`, not `master_key`.

If the user have administrator access, she also will be able to modify and remove the reports that you generated, perform operations that require `master_key` and add new members to the team.
