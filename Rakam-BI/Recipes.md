Recipes are basically a set of configurations for your projects represented as YAML file. They include reports, dashboards, custom reports, pages and configurations of your project and can be exported from one project and imported to another project.

In fact they're quite powerful because they're the represents your know-how of your industry. Let's say they we're running an e-commerce website. We can create an analytics service for an e-commerce application by creating reports for e-commerce website metrics, dashboards, funnels and retentions and export our recipe. When the recipe is imported in another project by another company or just another e-commerce website that we owned, we will have the exact same analytics service.

No matter which industry you're in IoT, e-commerce, gaming, mobile etc., we may create metrics, reports, dashboards depending on your needs and share it to you. The concept is that you don't need to use an analytics service for gaming industry, real-time website analytics etc seperately, the recipes can turn your empty project to a real analytics service.

If you have any specific question or want to cooperate with me for recipes, please contact me from emre@rakam.io.
