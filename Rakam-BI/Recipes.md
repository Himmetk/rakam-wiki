Recipes are basically a set of configurations for your projects represented as YAML file. They include reports, dashboards, custom reports, pages and configurations of your project and can be exported from one project and imported to another project.

In fact they're quite powerful because they are used for creating specialized analytics services for different industries. Let's say they we're running an e-commerce website, we can create an analytics service for an e-commerce application by creating reports for e-commerce website metrics, dashboards, funnels and retentions and export our recipe. When the recipe is imported in another project by another company or just another e-commerce website that we owned, we will have the exact same analytics service. 

It basically means that you can turn Rakam into an e-commerce analytics service with one click because we can provide the recipes for you depending on your industry. When you need custom reports, you can also specialize it for your specific needs.

No matter which industry you're in IoT, e-commerce, gaming, mobile etc., either we or your analysts may create metrics, reports, dashboards for on your needs and share it with other people. The concept is that you don't need to use an analytics service built just for gaming industry, real-time website analytics etc separately, the recipes can turn your empty project to a real analytics service.

If you have any specific question or want to cooperate with me for recipes, please contact me from emre@rakam.io.
